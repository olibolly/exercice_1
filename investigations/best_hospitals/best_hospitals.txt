The score for each hospital is being aggregated for time and effective care and readmissions and deaths.
The average score is being calculated by hospitals with no weighting per procedure or normalization done to each procedure score. 
The results are showing here that according to this approach the top hospitals are:

CENTRAL PENINSULA GENERAL HOSPITAL	72.97619047619048
PROVIDENCE SEWARD HOSPITAL	15.0
PETERSBURG MEDICAL CENTER	15.0
WRANGELL MEDICAL CENTER	15.0
SAMUEL SIMMONDS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL	17.5
SOUTH PENINSULA HOSPITAL	54.4
ROY LESTER SCHNEIDER HOSPITAL,THE	79.46153846153847
GOV JUAN F LUIS HOSPITAL & MEDICAL CTR	63.142857142857146
GUAM MEMORIAL HOSPITAL AUTHORITY	55.55172413793103
COMMONWEALTH HEALTH CENTER	16.75


One would need to investigate and discuss on the modeling of the score to assess if it reflects a true representation of quality. 
Also this does not take volume's of procedure into account or an eventual specialization of the hospital.
