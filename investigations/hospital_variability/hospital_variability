To infer the variability of each procedure - we will be using the standard deviation for each score. 
The latter is being compiled for each procedure. 

Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Admitted ED Patients	92.83178787038688
Admit Decision Time to ED Departure Time for Admitted Patients	62.1666505939829
Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Discharged ED Patients	40.70077322337158
Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility for Acute Coronary Intervention- Reporting Rate	29.479326601050527
Thrombolytic Therapy	21.954194561164023
Head CT Scan Results for Acute Ischemic Stroke or Hemorrhagic Stroke Patients who Received Head CT or MRI Scan Interpretation Within 45 Minutes of ED Arrival	21.844653491103774
Fibrinolytic Therapy Received within 30 Minutes of Hospital Arrival	18.7794213613377
Fibrinolytic Therapy Received Within 30 Minutes of ED Arrival	18.048443797995763
Median Time to Pain Management for Long Bone Fracture	17.722358013930915
Median Time from ED Arrival to Provider Contact for ED patients	16.882052975576602

It would be interesting to investigate further and understand the high deviation is meaningful for each procedure. One could imagine that for a benigh intervention, high median time wouldn't matter much, when it does for an urgent intervention
