We are looking at the correlation by hospital for the score we aggregated together with the survey score (already aggregated by hospitals).
The survey for patients seems to be measuring the quality of service such as communication, cleanlines, responsivenesss...
Rrather than trying to assess the quality of the intervention itself like the hospital scoring previously does. 

When running the correlation, we get a pearsons correlation score of 

-0.08375007233164833

which that there is NO correlation between both. 

It would be interesting to investigate the results further, maybe by breaking down by the different component of the survey or of the scores attached to hospitals.
